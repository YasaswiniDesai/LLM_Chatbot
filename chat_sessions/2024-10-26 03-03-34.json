It means that no two records have the same value for the candidate key. A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is chosen as the Primary Key based on design considerations.\n\nOn the other hand, a Super Key is a column or set of columns in a table that can uniquely identify all the records and include more columns than the Candidate Key. In other words, every super key is also a candidate key, but not every candidate key is a super key. A table may have multiple super keys.\n\nFor example, consider a table 'Students' with columns 'StudentID', 'FirstName', and 'LastName'. 'StudentID' is the primary key (candidate key) since it uniquely identifies each record. However, both 'FirstName' and 'LastName' together can also identify each record, making them a super key. But since having two columns as a primary key may not be efficient, only one is chosen as the primary key.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}, {"content": "Summarize this text:  Tell me about India", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}, {"content": " I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly understand or summarize texts about specific topics like \"India\" without being given that information first.
